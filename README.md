# Shipping Cost Of The Products

## Project Description:

You work is to design and implement an application using Java Script, to
be used to calculate the shipping cost of the products from China to
Germany in regular bases, You have several products to be shipped:
- Laptop which has a box size: 60x50x50 cm and weight of 6.5 kg.
- Mouse which has a box size: 30x30x20 cm and weight of 200 g.
- Desktop which has a box size: 100x150x50 cm and weight of 20 kg.
- LCD screens which has a box size 120x140x 80 cm and weight of 2.6kg.

You have at the same time 2 different shipping options:
- Small Container with 2.59m height, 2.43m wide, and 6.06m length.
- Big Container with 2.59m height, 2.43m wide, and 12.01m length.

### Where:
- The shipping cost for big container is 1800 Euro whatever the
shipment weight is.
- The shipping cost for small container 1000 Euro for 500 kg or less,
and 1200 Euro for weight more than 500kg.
Write a program that calculate the best shipping methods according to
your regular shipping products (Whatever number of the products that you
have).

The program must read from user the order information for example:
100Lap, 200 Mouse, 150 Desktop, 200 LCD screen, then calculate the best
shipping methods according to less price, for example (1 big container, or 2
big containers, or 1 big container and 1 small container, According to
